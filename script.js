const numbers = [2, 6, 12, 7, 22, 35];


// 1. Create a variable where you store the first element of the `numbers` array. Log it to the console.
// const firstEl = numbers[0];
// console.log(firstEl);


// 2. Create a variable where you store the last element of the `numbers` array. Log it to the console.
// const lastEl = numbers[numbers.length - 1];
// console.log(lastEl);


// 3. Create a variable where you store the fourth element of the `numbers` array. Log it to the console.
// const fourthEl = numbers[3];
// console.log(fourthEl);


// 4. Store the second and the fifth element of the `numbers` array in variables. Create a new array and populate it with those two variables. Log it to the console.
// const secondEl = numbers[1];
// const fifthEl = numbers[4];
// const newArray = [secondEl, fifthEl];
// console.log(newArray);


// 5. What is the length of the `numbers` array? Use the correct array property to save that number to a variable and log it to the console.
// const arrayLength = numbers.length;
// console.log(arrayLength);


// 6. Add an arbitrary number to the end of the `numbers` array with the correct array method. This array method returns a value. Save that to a variable and log it to the console. What does this number represent?
// const returnedValueAfterPush = numbers.push(99);
// console.log(returnedValueAfterPush);
// The returned number represent the numbers of elements in the Array after adding the new element.


// 7. Add an arbitrary number to the start of the `numbers` array using the correct array method. This method also returns a value. Log it to the console and reflect on what this value means.
// const returnedValueAfterUnshift = numbers.unshift(77);
// console.log(returnedValueAfterUnshift);
// The returned number represent the numbers of elements in the Array after adding the new element.


// 8. By now the `numbers` array should have been modified a couple of times. Let's shrink it again. Remove the last element from the array with an array method. This method should return a value as well. Log it to the console as see what it is.
// const returnedValueAfterPop = numbers.pop();
// console.log(returnedValueAfterPop);
// The returned number represent the element that have been deleted from the Array.


// 9. Do the same as the last one, but remove it from the beginning instead. Log the return value to the console.
// const returnedValueAfterShift = numbers.shift();
// The returned number represent the element that have been deleted from the Array.


// 10. If we have done the last couple of exercises correctly, we should have the same content as the default array. Log it out the console and see for yourself. 
// console.log(numbers);
